In this example, we simulate such a scenario using SlabSeaIceModel. Here, the bucket is perfectly insulated and infinitely deep, like many buckets are: if the Simulation is run for longer, the ice will keep freezing, and freezing, and will never run out of water. Also, the water in the infinite bucket is (somehow) all at the same temperature, in equilibrium with the ice-water interface (and therefore fixed at the melting temperature).
